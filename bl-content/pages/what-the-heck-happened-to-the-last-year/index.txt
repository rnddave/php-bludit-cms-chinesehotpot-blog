<p>Neither I nor my Wife have given any attention to this blog for over a year. Why not? No idea at all. Life just gets in the way!</p>
<h2>Colin turned 1</h2>
<p>Of course, we celebrated a birthday, which, truth be told was more a celebration of making it to year 1 for the parents than the child.</p>
<p>He’s learned how to walk and talk in the time since our last blog update. It’s hugely fascinating to see this little person grow and develop in front of you. To watch the personality start to come through and to see how early a child tries to exert dominance on the relationship (strength of character).</p>
<p>The early days of trying to get him to walk, fade as we seemed to find that we wanted him back in the pushchair so that we could get somewhere quicker, but he wanted to walk…</p>
<p>Then it changes again, he can walk at a decent pace now, granted, he’s easily distracted so we’re still not getting anywhere very fast, but now he doesn’t want to be in the pushchair and he doesn’t want to walk. He want’s to be carried. No idea why.</p>
<p>I know for all the seasoned parents, this is old news. You know this stuff, it’s normal. It’s also very interesting to experience for the first time.</p>
<h2>The family visited..</h2>
<p>My sister-in-law and mother-in-law came from China to the UK for a couple of months. The visit was great, we went all over the UK and I expect Xiao will add some posts on her experiences across the UK at some point.</p>
