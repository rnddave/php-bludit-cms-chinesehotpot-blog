<p>Just a short post to say we had another day on the south coast, this time to Weymouth, which I think is my favourite town on this stretch of the coast. </p>
<p>Weather this year has been amazing, the drive down from Bristol was a good couple of hours, but worth it upon arrival. </p>
<p>Tip; if you arrive after 15.00 (Saturday), parking in the car parks on the harbour, near the council offices is free! There aren't many car park spaces, so it takes a bit of luck, but free is free.</p>
