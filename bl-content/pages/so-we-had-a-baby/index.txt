<p>We actually started writing this blog <strong>back in mid 2017</strong>. At the time we started, we knew we were expecting a baby and had hoped to build up this blog with a little history before talking about the baby. I guess there were two main reasons;</p>
<ol>
<li>There was an ‘us’ before the baby and we wanted to talk about that period</li>
<li>We guessed that having a baby would be so exciting that once we got used to the regular update, we’d have bucket loads to talk about</li>
</ol>
<h3>Well, it didn’t happen.</h3>
<p>Life got in the way. Work got in the way. Before we knew it, the baby was here and <em>the baby got in the way</em>. <strong>Okay, he didn’t get in the way</strong>, but he certainly changes the way you think about using free time.</p>
<p>So back in May 2017 we found out we were expecting a baby. It was an amazing time, we both wanted a child, and we probably wanted to get started on that sooner rather than later. We’d both talked at length about wanting 2, ideally one of each, but appreciate you can’t chose and we’d be just as happy with two of the same.</p>
<p><strong>Was it a surprise</strong>, yeah, I guess so, but we’re both relatively well educated, we knew what we were doing, we weren’t being careful, we weren’t trying to avoid it, we just didn’t think we’d be so fortunate to have a baby so soon after trying.</p>
<p>Interestingly, looking back, Xiao recently said that maybe it would have been better to hold off a little, to enjoy being a married couple for a couple of years before adding a baby to the family. I completely get that, but the flip side is that the baby adds so much to our lives, we’d never change that for a second. To give advice to others, perhaps we’d say ‘be a couple for a little longer‘, but we’d never change what we have done and I suspect most parents feel the same.</p>
<p>With life getting in the way, the blog took a back seat, we had a domain [ <a href="http://www.chinesehotpot.co.uk/">http://www.chinesehotpot.co.uk</a> ] and a bunch of plans for blog content. We even started recording some silly little <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTNeZ2jMYSLeXGEBcWI-zzw">YouTube</a> videos which we could reference in the blog posts.</p>
<p>Ultimately we left the blog hanging for a year and pretty much forgot about it until the domain renewal came through this summer. The price of a domain is tiny, the price of hosting the website for a year was 6x higher so we decided to keep the domain name, but move the blog to my own hosting server, as such we do get another chance to see if we can actually build a blog..</p>
