<p>Today, the rain returned. The gardens needed it, that's for sure. I am probably very wrong, but I feel like this has been the longest period of nice weather that we've had in the UK for years. </p>
<p>It feels like it has barely rained since March/April this year, or if it did, it was through the night, therefore having very little impact on how we want to spend our days.</p>
<p>Of course, it may be also because I spend all of my working days at home, so although I do sit near the window, I haven't had to commute for 5 months or so, perhaps I just don't notice the rain because I don't have to go in the rain? </p>
