<p>Looking back at my post in early December, I am not surprised at all that we ended up in another lockdown. I think there were more people against it this time, more than any in the previous lockdowns.</p>
<p>I don't agree, I think the government made the right call, I just think that the reason they had to make that call was because they made 3 really bad calls in 2020:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ending lockdown 1 too soon</li>
<li>Taking too long to recognise lockdown 2 was needed</li>
<li>Ending lockdown 2 just in time for xmas drinking season</li>
</ol>
<p>I think that lockdown 3 was probably the longest, although I may just be guessing incorrectly here. Again, lockdown wasn't too hard for me and my immediate family, working from home continues to be a thing mostly and I enjoy all the extra time I get to spend with my family instead of sitting on a commuter train or in the car on the way to work etc.Â </p>
