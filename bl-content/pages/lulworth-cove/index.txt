<p>We took a trip to the South Coast again this week, this time to a place called Lulworth Cove which is one of the nicest coves to visit in the UK as far as I am aware, although I would be pleased to find a nicer one as this really does set the bar high. </p>
<p>The 'beach' is very small, as is usually the case with a cove, so it can get crowded at the best of times. We're still being careful to avoid catching Covid if possible, so we're not too keen on being bunched together with others, however, I have to say that whilst it was busy, there was still plenty of room for each group to have some decent space around them. </p>
<p>Furthermore as you venture away from the beach and up on to the cliff tops, you'll find a lot more space to sit and relax without worrying that someone else is going to setup camp next to you. </p>
<p>The path that walks along the cliff is the one exception, this path is always busy with people trying to see or visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durdle_Door" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Durdle Door.</a> </p>
<h2>Get some Fish and Chips! </h2>
<p>The dish that most mainland Chinese seem to think is our national food, which it isn't, but it is popular over here, although probably more so with tourists as it happens. That said, the Fish and Chips from <a href="http://finleyscafe.co.uk/fishchips.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Finley's Cafe</a> is amazing, highly recommend it! </p>
