<h2>China</h2>
<p>As 2019 rolled into 2020, the West started hearing about a virus in Wuhan. Initially the news announcements in the UK were quite light on detail, this seemed to be something limited to Wuhan. </p>
<p>Having a Chinese family back in China, we were hearing a little more, but it still seemed like a problem that was very far away. Our primary concern was for the health of our Chinese relatives. </p>
<h2>Memes and Jokes</h2>
<p>The spread of the virus was gaining traction, people were starting to talk about having to stay in doors, we were starting to hear more news items that suggested it might be something a little more important than the general population first thought. </p>
<p>It still seemed very far away, in fact, it was only a few weeks ago that people were still sending memes around in chat rooms, on Discord Servers and in Slack Channels. </p>
<p>I don't think it was 'The West enjoying the suffering of our fellow humans in the far East', it was just that it still seemed very far away. Further to this, no matter what sad things happen in the world, someone will always send a stupid meme to one group and it spreads until even the sensible people are starting to receive them as well. </p>
<p>That said, after the news last month of the UK's first lockdown, I think the humour has faded, the fear is starting to set in, we're embracing something that people are already calling <em><strong>the new normal</strong></em>. </p>
<h2>Travelling to Italy</h2>
<p>Again, looking back, it seems as though we in the UK were begging for the virus to arrive on our little island. </p>
<p>I know this is not true of most people, but as we're now starting hear, it seems skiing in Italy was one of the routes to spread across Europe. Of course, this is just conjecture and I am sure it will take a lot more investigation before we really know how this thing spread across the world so fast. </p>
<p>I should say that whilst I did not travel to Italy for a skiing holiday, I was there just 2 months ago for work, indeed I was in Milan which is currently under very sever lockdown restrictions, greater than those we have in the UK. </p>
<p>However, the difference between the UK and Italy, as a traveller, was remarkable. When I landed in Italy, there was the usual queues to get through customs etc, but then a final queue so that each of us could have our temperatures taken with what I think was some kind of infrared thermometer. Leaving the country was just as strict, making sure a person with a high temperature didn't board the plane, although I am not sure how much the virus could have spread whilst we were all stood next to anyone in that queue waiting to have their temperature taken, but at least the Italian officials were trying something.</p>
<p>In the UK I faced no such checks to board my flight, I also faced no such checks upon returning, indeed it was pretty much a normal experience where the plane lands, half the passengers are trying to get their bags before the 'seat-belt' light is turned off and then there is the race from the plane to the passport gates, that race where few people are actually running but everyone walks at a speed far greater than normal in order to get there before the queues build up.... </p>
<h2>Starting to be a thing in the UK</h2>
<p>Of course, as we now know, the virus was likely already here in the UK, but at the time, life seemed to continue as normal.</p>
<p>What we consider to be normal slowly morphed into something new, we started carrying hand wash with us, if we were lucky enough to have some in the house already. </p>
<h2>Where are all the Toilet Rolls? </h2>
<p>Along with hand wash, another unusual item that is difficult to find is toilet rolls. I genuinely don't know why, but you can't find one in any of the supermarkets close to us in South London. Luckily we had only recently purchased a large family pack, but how long will this last for?</p>
<p>The news reports shifted more and more of their focus to the spread of the virus, mostly in Europe and mostly with regards to Italy, but the UK is featuring in more and more reports, especially with regards to how people are clearing shelves in the supermarkets. </p>
<h2>Monday; another work trip</h2>
<p>I was due in Italy again at the end of February, I called my boss and asked if it was still safe to travel, the official advice was that unless the government close down the route, then we cannot cancel the flights, therefore I should follow agreed plans. </p>
<p>Xiao wasn't happy, but it was work and my bosses were still following official advice from the UK government, I actually work for a safety focused company, it is part of the culture, so I felt they would consider the risks as were known at the time.</p>
<p>My flight was on a Monday afternoon, flying out of London City, I had boarded a train in Croydon, I was in the terminal building when my phone rang. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Italy is on the red list, all travel approvals have been revoked unless you have Director written approval.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was relieved. Xiao was relieved. I jumped back on the train and headed south again. </p>
<h2>Tuesday; back in the office</h2>
<p>On Tuesday that week, I returned to my office in Central London, telling all that would listen about how close I was to getting on a plane to Italy. Suddenly there is an all-staff meeting, unplanned and out-of-character for my employer. </p>
<p>There had been confirmation that someone visiting our office had the virus. Tomorrow was going to be a 'work from home day' for all staff, again, another highly unusual action for my employer.</p>
<p>The building was closed and a professional cleaning company were brought in to deep clean the place. </p>
<h2>Thursday; back to the office</h2>
<p>Upon returning to the office and finding the place cleaner than I have ever seen it, I had a project meeting to attend. This was the kind of meeting where a lot of people sit in a small room and agree a strategy for moving forward. This was normal. </p>
<h2>Friday; on my way to the office</h2>
<p>Well as you might have imagined, that sitting in a small room with a lot of people wasn't the best idea. </p>
<p>I was on my way to the office and unusually for me, I had taken the car, so I was driving to the office as a departmental manager called me to say I needed to turn-around and return home, the office was to be deep cleaned again. </p>
<p>Driving into central London early on a Friday morning isn't too taxing, it takes about 45-60 minutes to cover 16km, which is disgusting anywhere else in the UK, but in London, that's not so bad. </p>
<p>Turning round and heading back, well I must have found every piece of traffic in the city. It took me a good 2 hours to do the return trip. When I finally managed to get home, turn the laptop on and logged in, I found an email to say that it was one of the people in my meeting room (Thursday) that had been confirmed as having the virus. Great news.</p>
<h2>A new week</h2>
<p>As the next week started, everyone from that meeting room was advised to stay home, continue working remotely. I stayed home. </p>
<p>Yet as the week went on, the office closed for another clean, then came the news that everyone was to just work from home, this was earlier than official government advice, but the disruptions and expense to the company seemed to ring some bells.</p>
<h2>Leaving London</h2>
<p>We have a very small apartment in London, it was fine for a couple, it was a bit of a squeeze when Colin came along, but our options were limited by just how expensive everything is in London.</p>
<p>However, working from home in a tiny little apartment with a 2 year old wandering about was difficult.</p>
<p>We decided to pack-up and go stay with my mom in the West Country for a couple of weeks, just until the government or we figure out what to do next. </p>
<p>We arrived at my mums on the 20th of March for a couple of weeks, Boris Johnson (PM) closed the country down on the 23rd of March So we haven't been back to London since. </p>
<p>It's only a month or so since we arrived here but there are immediate benefits. </p>
<p>For work, I have a whole room I can close my-self off from the rest of the household. The biggest difference is that we have access to a garden, and a decent size at that. Colin absolutely loves it here.</p>
<h2>America, what are you doing? </h2>
<p>As we hear more and more often in the UK;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>welcome to the new normal (or this is the new normal)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We're starting to get used to queueing up to buy things, we're getting used to not having access to the same sorts of shops, we're used to wearing masks, we're used to constantly washing our hands. </p>
<p>We watch the news each day, and whilst the UK news isn't reporting much about the US, I work for a US company and I am amazed at how relaxed they are about the virus, I fear they think the ocean will save them. </p>
<p>I sit and listen to meetings where the people from Beijing, Dubai and all of Europe talk about the 'new normal', the lockdowns, the strange shortages of toilet paper (UK only), yet when we get to the US colleagues, they are still acting like it's 2019, not a care in the world. It doesn't help that their president (Trump) seems to think it is all some kind of a hoax. </p>
<p>I hope they wake up and get with the rest of us, before it's too late. </p>
