<p>This is such a nice place to visit if you are in the south of the UK. Getting there from the direction of Bristol, Oxford or London is easy, it's very well connected considering it is so peaceful once you finally arrive. </p>
<p>The land area is huge, you can waste a day just driving around, but better still to drive there, park up and walk or cycle. You come across wild horses and other mammals throughout. Finding somewhere to sit and enjoy as picnic is no problem, the place is so big, you have no issue with having to share a piece of grass with a stranger. </p>
<p>It's a tourist trap, so the local shops will fleece you for a coffee or a sandwich, but that's the same anywhere you go that gets a few tourists (domestic or otherwise) so no complaints here. </p>
