<p><strong>Colin was born on the 13th of January, 2018</strong>. It’s probably going down as one of my most memorable dates from and for the rest of my life. Memorable reasons for more than just having this little ball of joy, but because it was actually a bit of a tough day. I’m sure Xiao has her own memories from her very unique point of view, but everyone forgets about the dad, granted, the level of pain is no where near that of the mum, but the journey isn’t exactly a stroll in the park.</p>
<p>Colin was actually due on the 30th December and in the run up, we actually thought he might be early. <strong>How wrong we were.</strong></p>
<p>In the run up to the due date, we went through the pain of getting Xiao’s mum a visa to visit the UK. <strong>Another UK Visa rejected at the first attempt</strong>, more money thrown into the UK Border Agency coffers for no fair reason! But we cracked it at the second attempt. Once her mom finally arrived, we rushed around trying to clear out some of the tourist stuff before settling in for the expected birth.</p>
<p>The baby was late but we were scared to go too far in case he came, furthermore, Xiao was at the 9 month mark, <strong>heavy, tired and uncomfortable</strong>, oh, and at the time, we had no idea how late he would end up being.</p>
<p>I’d finished work on about the 18th December, I’d expected to have a nice little xmas holiday followed by a couple of weeks of paternity leave. I’d said my goodbyes to the work colleagues, handed over my work and promptly forgot about anything to do with the office.</p>
<p>As we approached the end of my xmas holiday, on around the 4th January, I was starting to realise that Colin wasn’t going to be showing up any time soon. <strong>I reluctantly went back to work</strong>, of course my mind wasn’t on work at all, not even a little bit. We kept having checks with the local midwives, they didn’t seem too concerned, Colin appeared to be healthy and happy and <strong>just wasn’t ready to be out yet</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Two weeks past the due date</strong> and they decide to induce Xiao. So we packed an overnight bag and went to Croydon hospital. Looking back, I actually think we had some excitement. I guess we pretty much thought this was going to be a bit of a formality and we’d be coming home with a beautiful baby boy in a few hours, tomorrow morning at the latest.</p>
<p>First of all, the hospital had a pretty rigid rule about who was allowed to be there, that was limited to one person. I know Xiao wanted her mum there, but her mum doesn’t speak English and she also wanted me there, mainly for the English support. So whilst the three of us turned up at the hospital, her poor mum was sent home.</p>
<p>Xiao was checked over, her and the baby seemed to be in good health, but still no sign of a natural birth coming along anytime soon. The staff started Xiao on an induction sequence. <strong>Initially all seemed well</strong>, but as the day turned into night, the day staff left and the night shift turned up, the others in the ward came and went, usually with babies in hand, we sat there. Xiao was getting more and more uncomfortable but there was no sign of the baby.</p>
<p>Early contractions started, <strong>but everything was taking too long</strong>. The night shift finished and the day shift returned. They reviewed Xiao and they seemed a little more concerned than they were the day before. We were moved to another ward with private rooms. We were given our own midwife for the rest of the day, and she was absolutely amazing. <strong>She seemed to notice things that others weren’t paying attention to at the time</strong>.</p>
<p>One of the reasons we’d been moved to a private ward was that whilst the initial induction method had failed, Xiao and the baby were showing signs of distress. When in the private ward, they tried another induction technique, again, <strong>early signs that suggested success, soon fell away</strong>. Either Xiao or the baby or both would show signs of distress, so the staff would pull back, slow things down, then try again with different doses.</p>
<p>As the day shift came to an end and another night shift started, the evening doctor looked at the results <strong>from the last 30 odd hours</strong> and had a really good handover from our dedicated midwife, she decided that there was no choice, we simply couldn’t keep dragging this out, the patients were becoming more and more distressed throughout and that <strong>a Caesarean Section was the only way forward</strong>. They explained the reasons behind this, essentially one or both had picked up a bacterial virus which was causing the distress. It was a case of doing this now or risking that one, probably Colin, wouldn’t survive if we continued with trying to induce a natural birth.</p>
<p>This is where the medical terminology started piling on and I needed to step up my efforts of translating what the doctors were saying so that Xiao could keep informed. <strong>I was also trying very hard not to panic my wife,</strong> or start crying, for that matter, as a result of the stress I was feeling at that time.</p>
<p>Xiao agreed to the C-Section and we went straight to the theatre. They dressed me up and invited me in, I was worried, but Xiao was more worried, I kept talking to her, occasionally I’d try to translate some medical talk to Xiao and suddenly there was a little cry. Another person was in the room.</p>
<h2>Colin arrived.</h2>
<p><strong>I cut the cord</strong>, I got to hold him, <strong>I got to introduce my son to my wife</strong>. They fixed up Xiao. They cleaned up the baby. They sent us to a recovery ward <strong>where we ended up spending the next 5 days, </strong>whilst both of them recovered their strength and both worked through a series of anti-bacterials before we finally got the all clear and we could go home.</p>
<p>At the time, <strong>this was one of the most traumatic experiences in my life</strong>, I could remember almost every detail for a couple of weeks following, but eventually it starts to subside, that beautiful little baby and your happy, yet very tired, wife take your focus.</p>
<p>Telling everyone that asks, ‘when he was born’ and ‘how heavy he was’ (3.76kg), the small details slowly melt away. The challenges of parenthood takeover and replace those scary memories from the day he officially came out to join us.</p>
