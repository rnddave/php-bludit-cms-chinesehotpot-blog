<p>Since my last post, we've reached some grim milestones in the UK, I'm not going to report that here as this isn't a news source, we're just trying to get through it. </p>
<p>We left London on the 20th of March or there about, lockdown officially started 2-3 days later. We've had time to adjust to this new normal. Oh and if this pandemic has brought with it one  positive thing, it has to be that a whole generation will grow up with good hand washing habits. </p>
<h2>Supermarkets</h2>
<p>The supermarkets, in the West Country at least, have adapted, stock levels are under control, they have quantity limits in place to stop people hoarding toilet paper (I still don't know what that was about). We can buy almost every item we want from the supermarket, the only thing that seems to be hard to find is flour for baking, perhaps a whole nation has taken up baking? </p>
<p>There aren't queues to get inside anymore, yet when inside, there are one-way-systems and just in general, the number of people going to the supermarket has greatly reduced. Adding to that, the drive to the supermarket is almost pleasant, the roads are so empty these days. Dare I say it, I think I almost like going to the supermarket now... </p>
<h2>Working from home</h2>
<p>I always like working from home, I like it more so now. That said I have noticed a change in some of my colleagues. Initially, working from home was a bit of a novelty, but that was only for a day or two, then came a period of 'hyper responsiveness' whereby you'd send a chat message or an email, or make a call and the other person would answer or respond immediately. </p>
<p>I don't know if this was because they had nothing else to do, or as I suspect, people were going out of their way to prove that they could work from home (some departments/teams have a much stricter approach to working from home than we have in my team, so a lot of people have something to prove). </p>
<p>Now I'm seeing a new phase, people are less responsive, working hours have shifted, so for example you may not see colleagues come online until much later in the morning, some work later into the evening (I can tell by how late the emails arrive) and some stop for large periods of the day, only to make it up later. </p>
<p>This is an interesting shift to observe. In terms of individual productivity, I think home working is proving to be far more successful than some managers believed it would be. However, the team dynamic is suffering. These new working patterns and less immediate response means that people are growing disconnected from one-another. They are delivering their work as individuals, but the team dynamic has suffered. </p>
