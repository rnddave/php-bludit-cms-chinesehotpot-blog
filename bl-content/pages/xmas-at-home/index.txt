<p>We're not far from closing out 2020 and I think most people will be glad to see the back of it. </p>
<p>Looking back, our year, as a family unit, was not so bad. All the time I normally spend commuting or travelling, well that was all free time for my wife and son to enjoy, then looking beyond my immediate family unit, I saw my mom, my sisters and their children more this year than I probably did in the last 3-5 years combined! </p>
<h2>A new home</h2>
<p>Somewhere in the year that was 2020, we also moved, not just temporarily back to my moms house, but properly, to our own house. We're staying in the West Country (to live, although my office remains in London, so I will still commute once we go back to normal (aka, the old normal)). </p>
<p>So this Christmas marks the end of a bad year globally, but a nice year for us.</p>
<h2>Missing those that are further away</h2>
<p>We haven't seen our Chinese family members since November 2019, that's a little hard, especially for Xiao and I think Colin's grandparents and great grandparents miss him greatly. So we're all hoping for a better 2021. </p>
<p>Then there are those that aren't as far as China, family in the UK, friends, we miss them all dearly!</p>
