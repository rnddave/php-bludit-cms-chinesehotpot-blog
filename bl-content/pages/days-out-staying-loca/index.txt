<p>We've started going a little further from the house and the supermarket. The official advice is to stay local, but there is an ongoing argument as to just how far, local is from you...</p>
<p>In our case, we're staying in the West Country, probably within the same county in fact. </p>
<p>It does mean that we can take Colin out for some air and to see something different, get a little exercise perhaps, although play areas are all closed, so we don't take him to places where he might find one of those, else we have the difficult challenge of explaining to a 2 year old why he can't play with all the fun things... </p>
<p>Today we went to a little town called <strong>Severn Beach</strong> which is kind of a seaside town, but not really, in fact the town name gives it away, this is on the banks of the River Severn, which just so happens to feed into the Bristol Channel. </p>
<p>The nice thing about this place is that it is a tiny little town, there must be less than 10,000 people here I guess, yet it has a couple of nice long walks. Oh and a shop that sells ice-cream = win! </p>
