<p>We recently took some time to visit Birmingham's China Town to stock up on some Chinese foods. Luckily, food places were open for sitting outside (at the time of visit) and we were lucky enough to have some friendly weather, so we popped in to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/nYh6a6phVbGzaTkB8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hey Sugar</a> for a selection of bakery snacks, some bubble tea and a really great Red-Bean &amp; Matcha cake!</p>
<p>We we're also really lucky to be there soon after a business called <strong>Hey Yummy 88</strong> recently opened, at least we believe they only recently opened as they're not currently on Google Maps, but they can be found on Cathay St, next to Cafe Chino.We had Beef Noodles and a mix of steamed and fried bun (<span lang="zh"><span class="unicode haudio"><span class="fn"><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Zh-b%C4%81ozi.oga" class="internal" title="Zh-bāozi.oga">包子</a></span></span></span>). Heartily recommend this place, I will keep checking Google for more details, if they appear, I will provide a link to help find them.</p>

<h3>Did we say we're expecting Baby Number 2</h3>
<p>We're expecting our second baby any time now and 'things opening up' came a little late for that. All I can say is that we're both glad that this is our second baby.</p>
<p>We found out in September/October 2020 that we would be welcoming another baby, we later found out that the baby is a second boy, but, we found those things out in the time of Covid. Restrictions on what partners can attend, certainly in Wiltshire anyway, meant that only Mom can go to maternity check-ups, the dad doesn't get to listen to the heartbeat for the first time, doesn't get to see the baby on either of the normally scheduled scans, dad doesn't get to ask any questions (directly) or make sure that Mom is supported at key points.</p>
<p>So again, we're both glad that this wasn't our first experience of bringing a new life into the world as at least we've already been through that first journey, we have some expectations, it's not all new. I can only imagine how hard it is for first time parents!</p>
<h3>Even Baby Number 2 Can Surprise!</h3>
<p>We're lucky in that most things seem to have progressed nicely, apart from a couple of appointments that the midwife/hospital team just plane forgot to invite us to, we only found out later when, what should have been a follow-up appointment rushed us in for something that should have already happened...</p>
<p>There are still things that can go wrong and when one parent is not a native English speaker, keeping the other away, that can help bridge the gap between English and Mandarin, seems questionable at best. A couple of appointments finished with Mom-to-be leaving with a prescription and having no idea what it is for, let alone being able to tell dad-to-be why they now have to take this new medication.</p>
<p>But, we all now why they did what they did, so whilst we're glad it wasn't Baby-number-1, we do appreciate the NHS in the UK worked incredibly hard over the last 15 months or so to keep services operating and to basically keep people alive.</p>
<h3>Waiting for D-Day</h3>
<p>Due date is 18th May, Mom-to-be has been convinced this one would be early (baby-number-one was 2 weeks late), but at the time of writing, there are no signs of Baby-number-two coming out anytime soon.</p>
<p>We're both hoping that both parents can be there for the birth, I guess we'll find out when the new addition is ready to join us.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/book-coronavirus-vaccination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vaccine Rollout</a></h3>
<p>UK vaccine rollout is continuing at a blistering pace. <a href="https://www.chinesehotpot.co.uk/march-in-the-cotswolds#main">Things in the UK are opening</a> again and this time it seems like it might work. Vaccines are available for those at 38 an above I believe, restaurants are opening 17th May for eat-in customers, previously only open to eat-out customers.</p>
<p>Things seem to be normalising and that's a good thing.</p>
<h3>Getting the Vaccine</h3>
<p>Mom-to-be has been waiting for her chance to be vaccinated, as a key-worker, she has been able to book the vaccine for some time now, but with very little trial data for pregnant mums-to-be, she chose to hold off.</p>
<p>Dad-to-be had to wait until he fell into the correct age group, which happened recently.</p>
<p>The vaccone process in the UK was/is very smooth, there are some odd questions about allergies to the ingredients (which are not known by either of us, so how can we be sure if we're allergic or not?), but mostly the process involved booking a time-slot, arriving, queueing, answering questions, queueing, answering more questions, queueing again and answering some more questions before a shot in the arm.</p>
<h3>Vaccine Side-affects?</h3>
<p>I think there has been a lot of talk about side-affects, especially of the Oxford-AZ one, indeed we have friends that fell into the flu-like-symptoms category, but we have to say that beyond a soar arm for a couple of days and a little light sensitivity on the evening of the jab, it was a pretty painless process for David, but your mileage may vary.</p>
