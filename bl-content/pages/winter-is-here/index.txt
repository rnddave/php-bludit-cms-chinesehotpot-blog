<p>The Covid nightmare continues to rage on. We've just exited the second lockdown, I think there are a lot of things we could say about how we ended up in a second lockdown, but I'll be short on that one: </p>
<p><strong>The UK Government were too eager to get back to business! </strong></p>
<p>After soaring deaths and the increasing <strong>R number</strong>, things were starting to look very bad for the UK again. Eventually the government saw sense and sent us home again, I know it wasn't popular, people definitely found it harder to stick to the rules this time, the news reported some breach at least daily, but we did as we were told and now we're coming out of lockdown just in time for Christmas.</p>
<p>We're all left to hope this is the last one, but with Christmas fast approaching, I'm not sure. People always drink a lot and are a lot more social at this time of the year. I guess we'll just have to hope for the best. </p>
